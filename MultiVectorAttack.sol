Note: This is a simplified example of how you might structure the smart contract to carry out an attack with multiple vectors. Adjust it according to your needs and best practices (e.g., using SafeMath, checking return values). 

Remember that this code should be thoroughly audited before deployment for security vulnerabilities as well as potential issues related to gas costs or reentrancy attacks.
